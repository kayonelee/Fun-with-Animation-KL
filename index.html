    <h2>"It's easy to look sharp when you haven't done any work."</h2>

    <p>Our future is in the palm of our hands. Whether if it's sweat equity or monetary, we have to work for it. This quote reminds me a lot of the <i>"Don't judge a book by it's cover"</i> saying. Just because someone wears a suit and ties, it does not always mean they are successful or wealthy. Be humble and know that your hard work will pay off one day.</p>

    <p>Adults can dream. There is no age limit on when we should no longer dream. However, as adults we must put in the work in order to achieve it. Below are some basic tips/reminder to help you maintain your goal.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Write a daily to-do list</li>
        <li>Set a realistic timeline</li>
        <li>Have a backup plan</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>"If it doesn't challenge you, it won't change you."</h2>

    <p>Have you ever notice that within the word <i>challenge</i>, it also spells <i>change</i>? Often times, we worry too much about the end goal that we forget all about the journey it takes to reach our final destination. In order for us to see a change, we have to go through some level of pain or challenge. Come to an understanding that if everything in life was easy, there would be no growth. Being comfortable doesn't take you far in life.  </p>
